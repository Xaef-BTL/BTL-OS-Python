What's new in BTL 4.4 Ultra?



We know you’re tired of that ridiculous Lightning Browser in HTML5-powered BTL 4.3. Many users complained that the thick status bar at the bottom almost completely blocked the site view. With the latest build of 4.3, we’ve ditched Lightning Browser 2 and upgraded to 2.1 . Here’s what makes Lightning Browser 2.1 great:

/*
We removed all the unnecessary stuff.
Added an in-page search bar.
Slimmed down the status bar to give full site visibility.
Added tab management.
Performance improved by 15%.
DevTools included.
*/
We improved the Snake game, gave it a retro feel, and now you start the game by pressing R when you enter Snake.
For the Ball Catch game, it had stayed the same for a long time, so we gave it a little refresh and made it more fun.
And we added a Chess game. Sometimes the chess bot makes ridiculous moves, but it still works 😅 Anyway, to play Chess, type Chess in the BTL Start menu and click on BTL Chess.

We added Log on screen.

(Warning: BTL is still a work-in-progress system, and if minor bugs occur, please submit an issue or a pull request on GitHub.)


Thank you for choosing BTL.
